The [performance](https://web.dev/why-speed-matters/) of a webapp is the
lifeline of a digital business. Let's look at a way of monitoring your webapp
frontend budgets using github actions. The metrics we are going to be monitoring
are:

-   [Size Checks](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize)
-   [Lighthouse Audits](https://web.dev/measure/)
-   [Web Accessibility](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/accessibility/reference)
-   [Heap Snapshot](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/memory-problems)
-   [Unused Source](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/coverage)
